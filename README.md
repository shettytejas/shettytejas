# Hello, GitHub!

- ✍️ I generally work with languages like Java, Python, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3. (Now looking forward to work with TypeScript soon 🙂)
- 👨‍💻 I love working with technologies like Spring Framework (especially Spring Boot), NextJS, and ReactJS. (Many more to add in the near future 😉).
